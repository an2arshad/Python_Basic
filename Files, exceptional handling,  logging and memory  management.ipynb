Examples include Python and JavaScript. They allow for more flexibility and easier debugging but may run slower.\n","* Compiled languages are transformed into machine code by a compiler before execution. This results in faster execution times. Examples include C and C++. The compilation process can catch errors before runtime.\n","\n","Q2.What is exception handling in Python?\n","\n","-> Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to manage errors that occur during program execution. It allows developers to write code that can gracefully handle unexpected situations, preventing the program from crashing.\n","\n","Q3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","\n","-> Purpose of the finally block in exception handling:\n","\n","The finally block is used to execute code that must run regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n","\n","Q4.What is logging in Python?\n","\n","-> Logging in Python is a way to track events that happen during program execution. It provides a way to record messages, errors, and other information, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring applications.\n","\n","Q5.What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n","\n","-> Significance of the '__del__' method in Python:\n","\n","The '__del__' method is a destructor in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It can be used to release resources or perform cleanup actions before the object is removed from memory.\n","\n","Q6.What is the difference between 'import' and from '... import' in Python?\n","\n","-> Difference between 'import' and from '... import' in Python:\n","\n","'import' imports an entire module, allowing access to its functions and classes using the module name (e.g., 'import math' allows access via 'math.sqrt()').\n","'from ... import' imports specific attributes from a module directly into the current namespace, allowing for direct access without the module name (e.g., 'from math import sqrt' allows access via 'sqrt()').\n","\n","Q7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","\n","-> Handling multiple exceptions in Python:\n","\n","* Multiple exceptions can be handled using a single except block by specifying a tuple of exception types. For example:\n","\n","      try:\n","         # code that may raise exceptions\n","      except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n","         # handle TypeError and ValueError\n","     \n","\n","Q8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","\n","-> Purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python:\n","\n","The with statement simplifies file handling by automatically managing resources. It ensures that files are properly closed after their suite finishes, even if an error occurs, thus preventing resource leaks.\n","\n","Q9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","\n","-> Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing:\n","\n","Multithreading involves multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space. It is useful for I/O-bound tasks but can be limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.\n","Multiprocessing involves multiple processes, each with its own memory space. It is suitable for CPU-bound tasks and can take full advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n","\n","Q10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","\n","-> Advantages of using logging in a program:\n","\n","Logging provides a way to track application behavior, helps in debugging, allows for monitoring of application performance, and can be configured to log at different severity levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error).\n","\n","Q11.What is memory management in Python?\n","\n","-> Memory management in Python:\n","\n","Memory management in Python involves the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects. Python uses a private heap space to store objects and employs a garbage collector to reclaim memory from objects that are no longer in use.\n","\n","Q12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","\n","-> Basic steps involved in exception handling in Python:\n","\n","The basic steps are:\n","* Use a try block to wrap code that may raise an exception.\n","* Use one or more except blocks to handle specific exceptions.\n","* Optionally, use a finally block for cleanup actions.\n","* Optionally, use an else block to execute code if no exceptions were raised.\n","\n","Q13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n","\n","-> Importance of memory management in Python:\n","\n","Memory management is crucial to ensure efficient use of resources, prevent memory leaks, and maintain application performance. Proper memory management helps avoid crashes and ensures that applications run smoothly.\n","\n","Q14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","\n","-> Role of try and except in exception handling:\n","\n","The try block contains code that may raise an exception, while the except block defines how to respond to specific exceptions. This allows developers to handle errors gracefully without crashing the program.\n","\n","Q15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","\n","-> Python's garbage collection system primarily uses reference counting to track the number of references to each object. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it is automatically deallocated. Additionally, Python has a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up reference cycles that reference counting alone cannot handle.\n","\n","Q16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n","-> Purpose of the 'else' block in exception handling:\n","The else block in exception handling is executed if the code in the 'try' block does not raise any exceptions. It is useful for code that should run only when the 'try' block is successful, allowing for a clear separation of normal execution from error handling.\n","\n","Q17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","\n","-> Common logging levels in Python:\n","The common logging levels in Python, in order of severity, are:\n","* DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n","* INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n","* WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’).\n","* ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform a function.\n","* CRITICAL: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n","\n","Q18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","\n","-> Difference between 'os.fork()' and 'multiprocessing' in Python:\n","* 'os.fork()' is a low-level system call that creates a new process by duplicating the current process. It is specific to Unix-like operating systems and can lead to complex issues with shared state and resource management.\n","* The 'multiprocessing' module provides a higher-level interface for creating and managing processes in a platform-independent way. It abstracts away many of the complexities of process management and allows for easier communication between processes.\n","\n","Q19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n","-> Importance of closing a file in Python:\n","* Closing a file is important to free up system resources and ensure that all data is properly written to disk. Failing to close a file can lead to data loss, memory leaks, and file corruption. Using the with statement is a common practice to ensure files are closed automatically.\n","\n","Q20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","\n","-> Difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python:\n","* 'file.read()' reads the entire content of the file as a single string. It is useful for small files where you want to process all data at once.\n","* 'file.readline()' reads a single line from the file each time it is called. It is useful for processing large files line by line without loading the entire file into memory.\n","\n","Q21.What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","\n","-> Logging module in Python:\n","The logging module in Python is used for tracking events that happen during program execution. It provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs, allowing developers to configure log levels, output formats, and destinations (e.g., console, files).\n","\n","Q22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","\n","-> os module in Python for file handling:\n","The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, including file handling operations. It allows for tasks such as creating, removing, and changing directories, as well as manipulating file paths and checking file properties.\n","\n","Q23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","\n","-> Challenges associated with memory management in Python:\n","Challenges include:\n","Memory leaks due to circular references that the garbage collector cannot reclaim.\n","Overhead from automatic memory management, which can lead to performance issues.\n","Difficulty in predicting memory usage patterns, especially in large applications.\n","Managing memory in multi-threaded applications where multiple threads may allocate and deallocate memory simultaneously.\n","\n","Q24.How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","\n","-> Raising an exception manually in Python:\n","You can raise an exception manually using the raise statement. For example:\n","\n","\n","           raise ValueError(\"This is a custom error message.\")\n","\n","Q25.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","\n","-> Importance of using multithreading in certain applications:\n","Multithreading is important in applications that require concurrent execution of tasks, especially for I/O-bound operations (e.g., network requests, file I/O). It allows for better resource utilization, improved responsiveness, and the ability to perform background tasks without blocking the main thread, enhancing user experience in applications like web servers and GUI applications."],"metadata":{"id":"cnRI6kgmVj7R"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Practical Questions**"],"metadata":{"id":"OUqjkBWmgJuZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q1.
