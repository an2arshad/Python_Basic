What is a RESTful API?\n","\n","-> A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, which are identified by URLs. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process that request.\n","\n","Q2. Explain the concept of API specification.\n","\n","-> API specification is a detailed document that describes the endpoints, request and response formats, authentication methods, and other relevant details of an API. It serves as a contract between the API provider and consumers, ensuring that both parties have a clear understanding of how to interact with the API.\n","\n","Q3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n","\n","-> Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is designed to make it easy to build web applications and APIs. It is popular for building APIs due to its simplicity, flexibility, and the ability to scale from small applications to complex systems. Flask's minimalistic approach allows developers to add only the components they need.\n","\n","Q4. What is routing in Flask?\n","\n","-> Routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to specific functions (view functions) that handle requests to those URLs. This allows developers to define how the application responds to different HTTP requests based on the URL.\n","\n","Q5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n","\n","-> To create a simple Flask application, we can follow these steps:\n","\n","      from flask import Flask\n","\n","      app = Flask(__name__)\n","\n","      @app.route('/')\n","      def home():\n","          return \"Hello, Flask!\"\n","\n","      if __name__ == '__main__':\n","          app.run(debug=True)\n","\n","Q6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n","\n","-> The common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs include:\n","\n","* GET: Retrieve data from the server.\n","* POST: Send data to the server to create a new resource.\n","* PUT: Update an existing resource on the server.\n","* DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.\n","* PATCH: Partially update a resource on the server.\n","* OPTIONS: Describe the communication options for the target resource.\n","\n","Q7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n","\n","-> The '@app.route()' decorator is used to bind a URL to a specific function in Flask. It defines the endpoint for that route and specifies which HTTP methods are allowed for that endpoint.\n","\n","Q8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n","\n","* GET: Used to retrieve data from the server. It is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request. Data is sent in the URL (query parameters).\n","* POST: Used to send data to the server to create or update a resource. It is not idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests may result in different outcomes. Data is sent in the request body.\n","\n","Q9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n","\n","-> In Flask, we can handle errors by using the '@app.errorhandler()' decorator to define custom error handling functions. For example:\n","\n","      @app.errorhandler(404)\n","      def not_found(error):\n","          return jsonify({\"error\": \"Not found\"}), 404\n","\n","Q10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n","\n","-> To connect Flask to a SQL database, we can use an ORM like SQLAlchemy. Here’s a basic example:\n","\n","      from flask import Flask\n","      from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n","\n","      app = Flask(__name__)\n","      app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///example.db'\n","      db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n","\n","Q11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n","\n","-> Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension that integrates SQLAlchemy with Flask, providing a higher-level API for database operations. It simplifies database interactions and allows for easier management of database models and sessions.\n","\n","Q12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n","\n","-> Flask blueprints are a way to organize our application into modules. They allow us to define routes, error handlers, and other functionality in a modular way, making it easier to manage and scale our application. Blueprints can be registered with the main application, enabling a clean separation of concerns.\n","\n","Q13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n","\n","-> Flask's 'request' object contains all the data sent by the client in an HTTP request. This includes form data, query parameters, headers, and the request body. It allows developers to access and manipulate the incoming data easily.\n","\n","Q14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n","To create a RESTful API endpoint in Flask, we define a route and specify the allowed HTTP methods. Here’s an example of a simple endpoint:\n","\n","      from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n","\n","      app = Flask(__name__)\n","\n","      @app.route('/api/resource', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n","      def resource():\n","          if request.method == 'GET':\n","              return jsonify({\"message\": \"GET request received\"})\n","          elif request.method == 'POST':\n","              data = request.get_json()\n","              return jsonify({\"message\": \"Resource created\", \"data\": data}), 201\n","\n","Q15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n","\n","-> Flask's jsonify() function is used to convert Python dictionaries or lists into JSON responses. It automatically sets the correct content type (application/json) and handles serialization, making it easy to return JSON data from your API.\n","\n","Q16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function.\n","\n","-> Flask’s url_for() function generates a URL to a specific function based on its name. This allows for dynamic URL generation, making it easier to manage links within our application. For example:\n","\n","      @app.route('/user/<username>')\n","      def profile(username):\n","          return f\"Profile of {username}\"\n","\n","      # Generate URL for the profile function\n","      url = url_for('profile', username='john_doe')\n","\n","Q17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc)?\n","\n","-> Flask serves static files from the 'static' directory by default. we can place our CSS, JavaScript, and image files in this directory, and they can be accessed via the '/static/' URL path. For example, a file located at 'static/style.css' can be accessed at 'http://yourdomain.com/static/style.css.'\n","\n","Q18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n","\n","-> An API specification is a detailed document that outlines the endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and other relevant details of an API. It helps in building a Flask API by providing a clear contract for developers, ensuring consistency in implementation, and serving as a reference for both API providers and consumers.\n","\n","Q19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n","\n","-> HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by the server to indicate the result of an HTTP request. They are important in a Flask API because they provide information about the success or failure of a request, helping clients understand how to handle the response. Common status codes include:\n","\n","200 OK: The request was successful.\n","201 Created: A resource was successfully created.\n","400 Bad Request: The request was invalid.\n","404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found.\n","500 Internal Server Error: An error occurred on the server.\n","\n","Q20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n","\n","-> To handle POST requests in Flask, we can define a route that accepts the POST method and use the 'request' object to access the data sent by the client. Here's an example:\n","\n","      @app.route('/api/resource', methods=['POST'])\n","      def create_resource():\n","          data = request.get_json()  # Get JSON data from the request\n","          return jsonify({\"message\": \"Resource created\", \"data\": data}), 201\n","\n","Q21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n","\n","-> To secure a Flask API, we can implement several strategies:\n","\n","Use authentication methods such as API keys, OAuth, or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).\n","Implement HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.\n","Validate and sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks.\n","Use Flask extensions like Flask-Limiter to rate-limit requests and prevent abuse.\n","\n","Q22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n","\n","-> Flask-RESTful is an extension that simplifies the creation of REST APIs in Flask. It provides tools for resource management, automatic input validation, and better organization of code. It allows developers to define resources and their associated routes in a more structured way, making it easier to build and maintain APIs.\n","\n","Q23. What is the role of Flask's session object?\n","\n","-> Flask's 'session' object is used to store information specific to a user across requests. It allows you to maintain user sessions in web applications, enabling features like user authentication and personalized experiences. The session data is stored on the server side and can be accessed and modified during the user's interaction with the application."],"metadata":{"id":"-7AMVKBmkuUL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Practical**"],"metadata":{"id":"vSKfcGRI8rZg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q1.
